# MERN Book Store FullStack Web Application üìö
MERN Book Store is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, designed to manage and showcase a collection of books.
I have built a new application on the Bookstore using MERN stack. It features basic crud operations like users can add a new book into the system, get the details of the book, update the info of the book and can also delete a book. 




# Features ‚≠ê
*  Real-time database operations for seamless interaction.
*  Still leveraging RESTful API integration for fast, efficient back-end communication.
* CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books.
* Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly user interface for seamless browsing on any device.
* Pagination: Navigate through large collections of books with ease.
* Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for books.
